    Create the base model from the **MobileNet V2** model developed at Google

    First, pick which intermediate layer of MobileNet V2 will be used for feature extraction.

    The so-called "bottleneck layer". The reasoning here is that the following fully-connected layers 
    will be too specialized to the task the network was trained on, and thus the features learned by
    These layers won't be very useful for a new task. The bottleneck features, however, retain much generality.
    Let's instantiate an MobileNet V2 model pre-loaded with weights trained on ImageNet.

# Summary:
'''
* **Using a pre-trained model for feature extraction**:  When working with a small dataset, it is common to take advantage of features learned by a model trained on a larger dataset in the same domain. This is done by instantiating the pre-trained model and adding a fully-connected classifier on top. The pre-trained model is "frozen" and only the weights of the classifier get updated during training.
In this case, the convolutional base extracted all the features associated with each image and you just trained a classifier that determines the image class given that set of extracted features.
* **Fine-tuning a pre-trained model**: To further improve performance, one might want to repurpose the top-level layers of the pre-trained models to the new dataset via fine-tuning.
In this case, you tuned your weights such that your model learned high-level features specific to the dataset. This technique is usually recommended when the training dataset is large and very similar to the orginial dataset that the pre-trained model was trained on.
